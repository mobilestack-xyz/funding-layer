# Funding Layer

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

## Local testnet

Run the localtest in one terminal:

```
yarn hardhat node
```

And deploy in another:

```
# Copy-paste environment definition
SHELL=true yarn --silent hardhat --network hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
# or use eval
eval `SHELL=true yarn --silent hardhat --network hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts`
```

And create some dummy data:

```
yarn hardhat --network hardhat run scripts/setupTestnet.ts
```

## Scripts

### Fetch Referrals

Fetch referrals for a specific protocol, removes duplicate events across chains, and filters out events where the user was previously exposed to the protocol

```bash
yarn ts-node ./scripts/fetch-referrals.ts --protocol Beefy --output output.csv
```

### Referrer User Count

Fetch the count of users referred for a specific protocol. If no network IDs or referrer IDs are passed, get the user count for all referrers across all supported networks for that protocol.

```bash
# networkIds is optional
yarn ts-node ./scripts/referrerUserCount.ts --protocol Beefy --referrerIds app1 app2 app3 --networkIds celo-mainnet base-mainnet
```

### Referrer Revenue Summary

Fetch the revenue summary for specific protocols within a designated time frame. If no network IDs or referrer IDs are provided, this script will return the revenue summary for all referrers across all supported networks for that protocol. If no time frame is specified, the lifetime summary will be returned.

```bash
# networkIds, referrerIds, startTimestamp and endTimestamp are optional
yarn ts-node ./scripts/referrerRevenueSummary --protocol Beefy --outputFile output.csv --referrerIds app1 app2 app3 --networkIds celo-mainnet base-mainnet --startTimestamp 1737360000 --endTimestamp 1738108000
```

## Contracts

This repository contains the contract(s) necessary to support the Mobilestack Funding Layer.

Registry contract address: 0x5a1a1027aC1d828E7415AF7d797FBA2B0cDD5575

Owner safe: 0xfC95675a6bB93406C0CbBa9403a084Dd8D566F06

### Deployment Process

We use [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender) to manage deployments on Mainnet. Before beginning a deployment, make sure that your `.env` file is set up correctly. Namely, make sure to get the `DEFENDER_API_KEY`, `DEFENDER_API_SECRET`, `CELOSCAN_API_KEY` values from GSM and copy them in. (Ideally we could inject these config values into Hardhat automatically, but I haven't found a way to do that.)

To deploy, run:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network celo
```

After this is done, you should see output in your terminal with a command to run to verify the contract on the block explorers.
